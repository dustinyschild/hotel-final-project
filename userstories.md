# User Stories

As an owner:
- I want to differentiate myself from the rest of the market by giving my users a visual layout of the hotel, allowing them to be able to pick there exact room location.

As a user:
- I want to be able to choose exactly which room I will be staying in.
- I want to be able to filter the rooms by room type and available amenities.
- I want the contact info to be easy to find.
- I want confirmation as to what I have reserved.

As a marketer:
- I always want rooms to be available, therefore amenities without available rooms should be hidden.
- I want multiple links in order to drive users to the room reservation page.
- I want to hook the customer by only showing them the price after the room they want is selected.

As a developer:
- I want a stylesheet for coherent and consistent layout and color palette.
- I want all room info organized in Objects.
- I want date reservation info organized in a single object.
- I want to store the whole hotel in an array in order to easily incorporate other locations in the future.
- I want to break down the project into Issues that can be easily worked on thru the github project.
